// Per-session async mutex for the pane delivery path.
//
// DELIVLOCK805: two writers streaming a chunked `send-keys -l` message into the
// SAME tmux pane interleave their chunks (proven reproduction: writer B's text
// landed inside writer A's `[Uzenet @marveen-tol]:` frame, and the two messages
// coalesced into one submitted line). Foreign text inside a trusted-sender
// frame is a prompt-injection surface, so the delivery path must be mutually
// exclusive per pane.
//
// SCOPE (measured, do not overstate): an in-process mutex serializes only the
// writers that ACQUIRE it. Same-process is NOT the same as serialized. As of
// this change EXACTLY TWO call sites take the lock (grep -rln withSessionSendLock
// src -> agent-process.ts, channel-monitor.ts): sendPromptToSession's emit span
// (so every caller that delivers through it -- message-router, schedule-runner,
// inbox-nudge-watcher, channel-monitor delivery, context-guard-runner, the
// stuck-input re-inject, agent-worker dispatch, routes/agents /login -- is
// serialized against every other), and channel-monitor's recover-mode
// clear+re-inject. The dashboard singleton (O_EXCL pidfile, index.ts) is what
// makes an in-process mutex sufficient FOR THOSE; no file lock is needed there.
//
// STILL UNGUARDED (in-process writers that hit the pane with a direct tmux
// send-keys and do NOT go through the lock -- tracked as PANEWRITERS805):
// channel-mcp-reconnect.ts, channel-plugin-unlock.ts, reauth-healer.ts,
// agent-worker.ts's /clear, routes/agent-terminal.ts, and sendPromptToSession's
// OWN three modal dismissals (dismissSurveyModal / dismissResumeSummary /
// dismissModelConsent), which run BEFORE the lock is taken. Also NOT covered:
// the channel plugin's own in-band delivery -- a separate bun poller process
// that injects channel text through the plugin runtime and never calls
// sendPromptToSession, so no in-process lock can reach it (a cross-process file
// lock would be a separate change). A reader must not assume the pane is fully
// serialized: it is serialized for the two acquirers above, no more.
