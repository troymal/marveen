// Pure logic for the per-agent auto-restart feature.
//
// A long-lived Claude Code session accumulates context: every turn re-reads the
// whole transcript, so a big context is slower and costlier and hits the
// per-session limit sooner. Restarting periodically (by default after the
// nightly dream consolidation -- "the brain sleeps, tidies up, wakes fresh")
// keeps sessions lean. Two modes:
//   - 'fresh':    drop the conversation (start without --continue) -- the speed-up.
//   - 'continue': keep the conversation (--continue) but re-spawn the process,
//                 so a tier/limit-budget refresh takes effect without losing context.
//
// This module is dependency-free so the due-decision is unit-testable without a
// clock, tmux, or the filesystem. The I/O (reading the config store, checking the
// pane is idle, performing the restart) lives in src/web/auto-restart-runner.ts.
